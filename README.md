# Getting Started with Create React App
https://screen-ide.coderpad.io/?id=85704899b646ff833f2c9f075fb9b14ecd5f0d3
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

To implement BlurHash with React.js for loading 100 images, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: You need the `blurhash` library for encoding and decoding BlurHash strings and `react-blurhash` for displaying BlurHash placeholders in React.

```bash
npm install blurhash react-blurhash
```

2. **Create a Component to Display Images with BlurHash Placeholders**:

Here is an example implementation:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Blurhash } from 'react-blurhash';
import { encode } from 'blurhash';

const ImageWithBlurhash = ({ src }) => {
  const [blurhash, setBlurhash] = useState('');
  const [imageLoaded, setImageLoaded] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const img = new Image();
    img.src = src;
    img.crossOrigin = 'Anonymous';
    img.onload = () => {
      const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
      canvas.width = img.width;
      canvas.height = img.height;
      const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
      context.drawImage(img, 0, 0, img.width, img.height);
      const imageData = context.getImageData(0, 0, img.width, img.height);
      const blurhash = encode(imageData.data, imageData.width, imageData.height, 4, 4);
      setBlurhash(blurhash);
      setImageLoaded(true);
    };
  }, [src]);

  return (
    <div style={{ width: '400px', height: '300px', position: 'relative' }}>
      {imageLoaded ? (
        <img src={src} alt="Loaded" style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }} />
      ) : (
        <Blurhash
          hash={blurhash}
          width={400}
          height={300}
          resolutionX={32}
          resolutionY={32}
          punch={1}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

const ImageGallery = ({ images }) => {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
      {images.map((image, index) => (
        <ImageWithBlurhash key={index} src={image} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  const imageUrls = [
    // Array of 100 image URLs
  ];

  return <ImageGallery images={imageUrls} />;
};

export default App;
```

### Explanation

1. **ImageWithBlurhash Component**:
    - This component handles loading the image and generating the BlurHash.
    - It uses a `useState` hook to manage the BlurHash string and the loading state of the image.
    - The `useEffect` hook loads the image and generates the BlurHash when the component mounts.
    - If the image is loaded, it displays the image. Otherwise, it displays the BlurHash placeholder.

2. **ImageGallery Component**:
    - This component maps through the array of image URLs and renders the `ImageWithBlurhash` component for each URL.

3. **App Component**:
    - This is the main component that includes the `ImageGallery` component and passes an array of image URLs.

Replace the `imageUrls` array with the actual URLs of the 100 images you want to load. This approach ensures that while the high-resolution images are loading, a BlurHash placeholder is displayed to enhance the user experience.
